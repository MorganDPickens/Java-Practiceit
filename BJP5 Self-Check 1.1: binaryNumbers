Sound F/X
Why do computers use binary numbers?

    It is easier to build electronic devices reliably if they only have to distinguish between two electric states.
    It is impossible to build a computer that uses a different number base than binary.
    It makes the computer faster and more efficient than other number bases.
    Because there are 10 types of people: Those who understand binary, and those who don't.
    At the time when computers were invented, humans only knew about the numbers 0 and 1.


My answer: t is easier to build electronic devices reliably if they only have to distinguish between two electric states.
